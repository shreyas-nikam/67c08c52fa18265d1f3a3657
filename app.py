# Introduction and Context
st.markdown("""
    ## Understanding US Banks' Stress Testing Practices

    This application provides an interactive visualization of stress testing practices at major US banks, 
    including Citigroup, Bank of America, and JP Morgan Chase. 
    Stress testing is a critical component of risk management in financial institutions, 
    designed to evaluate the potential impact of adverse economic scenarios on a bank's financial health.

    **Based on the 'US Banks' Stress Testing Practices' document, this tool helps you explore:**
    - Different types of stress tests conducted by banks.
    - The frequency and focus of stress testing activities.
    - Potential impacts of various stress scenarios.

    **Learning Outcomes:**
    - Understand key insights into US banks' stress testing practices.
    - Learn to visualize financial data using Streamlit.
    - Explore data preprocessing and interactive data exploration.

    **Dataset**: This application uses a synthetic dataset designed to mimic real-world stress testing data. 
    This dataset includes information on banks, types of stress tests, frequency, and hypothetical impact metrics.

# Additional Information and Explanations
st.markdown("## Key Concepts and Further Exploration")
st.markdown("""
    - **Stress Testing**: A process used by financial institutions to evaluate their potential vulnerability to adverse economic or financial events. It helps in assessing capital adequacy and risk management practices.
    - **Types of Stress Tests**:
        - **Credit Risk**: Assesses potential losses from defaults on loans and other credit exposures.
        - **Market Risk**: Evaluates the impact of changes in market conditions (e.g., interest rates, exchange rates, equity prices) on the bank's portfolio.
        - **Operational Risk**: Examines potential losses from failures in internal processes, systems, or external events.
        - **Liquidity Risk**: Assesses the bank's ability to meet its short-term financial obligations.
    - **Importance of Stress Testing**: Regulatory requirements, internal risk management, and maintaining financial stability.

    **Reference**: This application is inspired by the practices documented in 'US Banks' Stress Testing Practices'. 
    For more detailed information on stress testing methodologies and regulatory frameworks, refer to financial risk management resources and regulatory guidelines.
